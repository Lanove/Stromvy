Modification done on PCB
- Swapped Inverting and Non-inverting of U5G4 (Voltage op-amp)
- Swapped D+ and D-
- Swapped SDA and SCL
- Used bigger transistor for Q5/Q6 (Series Pass Driver)
- Use 10 ohm for resistor of series pass transistor
- Didn't use C36,C34 and C33 or high pass frequency capacitor
- Use 4-wire sensing for current amplifier (Modified non-inverting amp to differential amp for current amp)
- Use ADS1115 for ADC (With ferrite filter on ADS supply)

To-do modification / Good thing to consider on next version :
- Use FAN label instead of LO (on schematic and code).
- Tie BOOT1 to GND with 10k, and BOOT0 to GND with 10k and button that is connected to 3v3
- Add debouncing capacitor for RST and BOOT0 button
- Change connector that is too big for Fan,LCD,Encoder and other connectors that are similar.
- Add RTC Power protection with BAT54, and add RTC battery connector.
- Use 2n7002 for relay and buzzer
- Move load relay to after emittor of series pass transistor
- Use bigger transistor for Q5/Q6 (Series Pass Driver)
- Remove U5G1 because U5G3 already fulfill the CC/CV detection job
- Remove ferrite bead on VADC of STM32F
- ADD JTAG header for debugging
- Make the PCB smaller (Pack the component closer)
- Add sense relay (and auto detection)
- Use small button for RST and BOOT0 button
